Challenges Faced in Assignment 2:
Assignment 2 was an enriching experience that required a deep understanding of both fundamental and advanced C programming concepts. One of the significant challenges was implementing the grid-based game, particularly managing the player's movement while adhering to game constraints like obstacles and boundaries. Additionally, solving problems involving conversions between different numeral systems (hexadecimal, binary, and decimal) was complex due to the need for precise logic and error handling. Designing user-friendly and interactive solutions while maintaining code efficiency required careful planning and debugging. These tasks not only tested my problem-solving skills but also enhanced my understanding of arrays, string manipulations, and modular programming in C. Overall, overcoming these challenges provided a strong foundation for future projects.
